# My first portfolio project on CodeCademy
### It generates a randomized, usually rather nonsensical message, combining a historical figure, an action of some sort and an object with respect to which the action is performed, in that order.

It certainly served its purpose as it required me to apply all the core skills that I have been learning thus far on Codecademy's platform.
